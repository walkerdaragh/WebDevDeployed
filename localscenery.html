                                          As mentioned the roots of this town is based on the sea access. This still holds true with the multiple of <br>
                                          clubs from sailing, kayaking, surfing and scuba diving. Or if you want to keep your feet on dry land, the West <br>
                                          and East Pier have great walking paths. You will find tea,coffee, ice-cream and food stalls on the East Pier <br>
                                          especially on the Weekend as it connects to the Food Market. The Harbour does have onsite parking which  <br>
                                          works best at the full days rate of only €5.00. Please note that cycling and skating on the East Pier is only  <br>
                                          allowed at certain hours. The West Pier is the longest of the two and you will find a big numbers of people <br>
                                          fishing near the light house, just another connection back to this towns roots.
